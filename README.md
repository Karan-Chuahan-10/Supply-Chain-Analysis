## About The Project
Implemented supply chain analysis using Python, employing pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy libraries to optimize operations. Analyzed product availability, transportation modes, defect rates, customer demographics, and pricing for improved supply chain performance. Conducted revenue and transportation cost analysis to facilitate informed decision-making and strategic planning. Presented key insights through visualizations for better understanding and actionable outcomes.

## Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook:**  Used for cleaning and extracting the sentiment from the source code  

- **Microsoft Excel:** Excel is utilized for data preparation tasks such as importing raw data, cleaning and transforming data, and performing preliminary analysis. It provides a familiar and versatile environment for handling structured data efficiently.

## Approach
- **Approach:**
In this supply chain analysis project, I employed Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy to optimize operations. By analyzing product availability, transportation modes, defect rates, customer demographics, and pricing, I aimed to improve supply chain performance. I conducted revenue and transportation cost analysis to facilitate informed decision-making and strategic planning, presenting key insights through visualizations for better understanding and actionable outcomes. Through data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization, I optimized supply chain operations, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making and strategic planning for stakeholders.

## Key Features:

- **Data Exploration:** Utilized pandas library to explore and manipulate large datasets containing information on product availability, defect rates, customer demographics, and more.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applied statistical methods and techniques to analyze supply chain data, including calculating average prices by product type and assessing revenue and transportation costs.
- **Problem Solving:** Identified supply chain challenges and opportunities for optimization through data-driven analysis and strategic thinking.
- **Decision Support:** Provided actionable recommendations based on analysis results to enhance operational efficiency and financial performance within the supply chain.
- **Project Management:** Successfully planned, executed, and delivered the project, ensuring timely completion and achievement of project objectives.
- **Collaboration:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather data, analyze findings, and implement solutions, demonstrating effective teamwork and communication skills.
- **Outcome Visualization:** Communicated key findings and insights effectively through visualizations, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and drive supply chain improvements.

## Benefits:
- **Efficiency Boost:** The analysis identifies inefficiencies in the supply chain, enabling organizations to streamline processes and reduce operational costs.
-**Data-Driven Decisions:** Insights from the analysis empower decision-makers to make informed choices, optimizing inventory management, transportation routes, and procurement strategies.
- **Risk Reduction:** By identifying and mitigating supply chain risks such as product defects and transportation delays, organizations can ensure smoother operations and minimize disruptions.
- **Customer-Centric Approach:** Understanding customer demographics and preferences allows organizations to tailor products and services to meet customer needs, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Competitive Advantage:** Leveraging data analysis for supply chain optimization provides a competitive edge, enabling organizations to adapt quickly to market changes and outperform rivals.

## Status
- Supply Chain Analysis **Completed**
